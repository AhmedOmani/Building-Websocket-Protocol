# Building WebSocket Protocol

This is an educational project demonstrating the basics of building a WebSocket protocol from scratch using Node.js. The project is designed to help learners understand how WebSocket communication works at a low level, including protocol constants, methods, and server implementation.


## Features
- Custom implementation of WebSocket protocol basics
- Educational code structure for easy learning
- Simple client-server communication

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
2. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open `index.html` in your browser to connect to the server.

## Educational Goals
- Learn how WebSocket handshakes work
- Understand message framing and protocol constants
- Explore basic client-server communication using WebSockets
